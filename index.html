  <li><b>What is the most complex or interesting thing you've done with your current web development skills? </b></li>
    <ul>
      <li> <p>This is the first time I've ever been able to make a website on my own, let alone coding in general since I haven't taken many coding courses. So technically this would be the coolest thing so far!</p></li>

  <li> <b> What do you hope to learn from this class?</b></li>

      <li> <p>I hope to learn more about websites so I would be able to host my own so I wouldn't have the need to buy services in order to post whatever I want online on a website.</p></li>

         <li><p> I have this condition called, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photic_sneeze_reflex">"photo optic sneezing reflex"</a> where whenever I look at a bright light I sneeze a couple of times. Yes, this happens often. </p></li>
         <li><p> When I was born I was too fat so they had to break my collar bone. I still can feel the dent, it's not that big though. </p></li>
